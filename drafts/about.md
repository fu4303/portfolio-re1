- What do I want to tell about myself?

  - interests

    - helps determining common fields of expertise and might also be useful for potential clients

    â†’ Back and front of frontend and also front of backend. So basically full-stack but I do not like data too much.

  - how to get in touch

    â†’ email: markus@re1.dev
    â†’ telegram? (@re1tg) â€“ Might be a good idea to avoid sharing my phone number ðŸ¤”
    â†’ twitter? (@\_re1tw) â€“ Add later. Not right away. Twitter profile needs improvement first.
    â†’ GitHub (@re1)

  - who am I

    Really not too much to say here. Maybe just leave a note on education and work.

    - Learned information technology
    - Self-employed software developer with a focus on modern web technologies
    - Perfectionist

- Who is in my target group, what do they expect, how to communicate with them?

  - friends & colleagues â†’ writing, notes, wiki â†’ Relaxed, friendly
  - potential clients â†’ references, time, technologies â†’ At least some self marketing, friendly, motivated?
  - developers â†’ work, notes and writing â†’ Relaxed, easy language

- What information is expected?

  - email â†’ <markus@re1.dev>
  - public key
  - availability â†’ Set a status?
  - region â†’ Austria (Linz, Vienna), Munich?

  â†’ Add a direct link to contact information for clients

Maybe I do not need an about page. This website is mostly about me already. So I might just put everything on the front page.
